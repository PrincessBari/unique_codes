# unique_codes

I wrote this python code because each month I have to read several excel files into Power BI. And then for part of the dashboard,
I have to create one filter that works on two different pages. What this means is that I have to look at two different 
spreadsheets and see what unique values appear in the "Agency Code" column for each one. Then, I have to write a warning
on one of the dashboard pages that explain that for the agency codes that do not appear in that visualization's underlying 
data set, the graph will appear blank.
